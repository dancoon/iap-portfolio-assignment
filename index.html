            Extended Universe (2013 - 2023), Geralt of Rivia in the Netflix fantasy series The Witcher (2019 - 2023),

        <h3>Employment History</h3>
        <p>Cavill began his film career with a role in Laguna (2001) and Kevin Reynolds' adaptation of The Count of
            Monte Cristo (2002). He continued with appearances in BBC's The Inspector Lynley Mysteries (2002), the
            television film Goodbye, Mr. Chips (2002), and the television series Midsomer Murders (2003). In 2003, he
            had a supporting role in I Capture the Castle, followed by Hellraiser: Hellworld (2005), Red Riding Hood
            (2006) and Tristan & Isolde (2006). He had a minor role in Matthew Vaughn's adaptation of Stardust
            (2007).

            Cavill attending the premiere of Whatever Works at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival
            From 2007 to 2010, Cavill had a leading role in Showtime's television series The Tudors, as Charles Brandon,
            1st Duke of Suffolk. The series was commercially well-received and it went on to be nominated for a Golden
            Globe in 2007 and won an Emmy in 2008. Cavill gave the show credit for bolstering his career: "It's done the
            most for me to date. [...] Now that there's an audience somewhere in America that's aware of who I am, I
            have more sell-ability, because of The Tudors."[13] Entertainment Weekly named him the "Most Dashing Duke"
            and praised his work on The Tudors for displaying "charm, depth and a killer bod".

            Cavill had been set to play Superman in McG's 2004 film, Superman: Flyby. McG pulled out of the project and
            direction was taken over by director Bryan Singer, who recast Brandon Routh as the lead in Superman
            Returns.[15][16] Cavill was also the cause of a write-in effort from fans to see him cast as Cedric Diggory
            in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005). The role eventually went to Robert Pattinson. Stephenie
            Meyer, the author of the Twilight series, was outspoken in favour of Cavill playing the character of Edward
            Cullen in the Twilight film,[18] calling him her "perfect Edward". However, by the time production of
            the film began, Cavill was too old to play the character,[19][20] and again the role went to Pattinson.
            Despite reports that he was a contender for Batman in Batman Begins, Cavill confirmed that he never
            auditioned for, nor was offered, the role.

            In 2005, Cavill was a final choice for the role of James Bond in Casino Royale. The producers and
            director Martin Campbell were torn between him and Daniel Craig; reportedly Campbell supported Cavill but
            the producers preferred an older Bond, and Craig ultimately landed the role.

            While appearing in The Tudors, Cavill starred in director Joel Schumacher's horror film, Blood Creek (2008),
            and had a supporting role in Woody Allen's comedy film Whatever Works (2009). He went on to play the
            lead role of Theseus in Tarsem Singh's mythological film, Immortals, released 11 November 2011,[24] and
            starred, alongside Bruce Willis, in The Cold Light of Day released in 2012.[25]

            On 30 January 2011, it was announced that Cavill had been cast in the role of Clark Kent / Superman in
            director Zack Snyder's Man of Steel.[26] Snyder called Cavill "the perfect choice to don the cape and S
            shield." Entertainment media applauded Henry Cavill on his road to success. On being chosen
            for the role, Cavill commented, "In the pantheon of superheroes, Superman is the most recognized and revered
            character of all time, and I am honoured to be a part of his return to the big screen." Cavill reprised
            the role of Superman in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, a 2016 sequel which featured a crossover with
            Batman[32] and Wonder Woman. He attended the San Diego Comic-Con in disguise to surprise the cast of
            Suicide Squad.


            Cavill at the 2016 San Diego Comic Con
            Cavill returned as Superman in the 2017 theatrical version of Justice League, which had been reworked by
            director Joss Whedon after Snyder left the project due to a family tragedy.[36] He appeared again in Zack
            Snyder's Justice League which premiered on HBO Max in March 2021 after an intense fan campaign to see the
            Snyder cut.[37] His manager Dany Garcia said in 2016 that he was working on a new standalone Superman
            film.[38] Directors Matthew Vaughn[39] and Christopher McQuarrie[40] were reportedly interested. Shortly
            after the release of Justice League, Cavill revealed he was under contract to play Superman in one more
            film.[41]

            In 2015, he co-starred with Armie Hammer in the film version of spy series The Man from U.N.C.L.E, directed
            by Guy Ritchie.[42][43][44] In 2018, Cavill co-starred as August Walker in the action spy film Mission:
            Impossible - Fallout, the sixth installment of the film series. Later that year, he starred in the
            psychological thriller Night Hunter (originally titled Nomis).[45] Cavill has expressed interest in taking
            over the role of James Bond after Daniel Craig leaves the role.[46]

            From 2019 to 2023, Cavill portrayed the mutant monster hunter Geralt of Rivia in the hit Netflix fantasy
            drama The Witcher, an adaptation of the book series of the same name by Polish author Andrzej
            Sapkowski.[47][48][49] The series premiered on 20 December 2019 [50] and had its early premiere on Służewiec
            Racetrack in Warsaw on 18 December 2019.[51] In late October 2022, Cavill and Netflix announced that he
            would exit from The Witcher after the third season released in 2023, and would be replaced by Liam
            Hemsworth.

            On 27 June 2019, it was announced that Cavill would portray Sherlock Holmes in Legendary Entertainment's
            film adaptation of The Enola Holmes Mysteries, with Millie Bobby Brown in the eponymous role.[54] On 13 May
            2021, it was announced that he would reprise his role in Enola Holmes 2.[55]

            On 21 May 2021, it was announced that Cavill would portray the lead role in the reboot of Highlander,
            although his exact character is unknown.[56] On 8 July 2021, it was announced that Cavill would join an
            all-star cast for director Matthew Vaughn's new spy film Argylle.[57][58] The same month, an article by
            Deadline reported that he would star in The Rosie Project, directed by Steve Falk and based on the book of
            the same name, written by Australian author Graeme Simsion.[59]

            Cavill negotiated what was intended to be a one-time contract with Warner Bros. to return as Superman in
            Black Adam,[60] and appeared in a cameo in the mid-credit scene of the film.[61][62] Later a sequel to Man
            of Steel was put back in development, with Cavill set to return.[63] He confirmed in October 2022 that he
            would appear in future DCEU films and referred to his mid-credits cameo as "just a very small taste of
            things to come".[64] However, in December 2022 Cavill released a statement saying that his future
            involvement as Superman was no longer moving forward after meeting with new DC Studios executives James Gunn
            and Peter Safran; Variety reported that Cavill is eyed to play a different DC character.[65]

            Cavill will reteam with director Guy Ritchie on the World War II spy film The Ministry of Ungentlemanly
            Warfare, with Jerry Bruckheimer producing.[66] The film is based on a true story by British author Damien
            Lewis.

            After the acquisition of global rights to the Warhammer 40,000 franchise by Amazon Studios in December 2022,
            Cavill was attached to star in and executive produce projects related to it.</p>
